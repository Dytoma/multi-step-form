## Overview

  For this solution, I used react, react router and tailwind css. It was fun building it although it took me a lot of time. I definitely liked React and probably gonna use it from now on.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I was just starting learning react and I used it to complete this project. At first it was confusing and a bit difficult but after some practice I gained some knowledge and used it for this project. I did not focus on best practices of react, my main purpose was to complete this challenge and I'm actually glad I did it.


### Continued development

For my next project I will focus on best practices in react and start learning Redux, MUI or styled components in order to master this library.
